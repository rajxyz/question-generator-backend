After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called

chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal

blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with

each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between

developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 2.12).

The placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the

embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials

produced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through

an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from

the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces

several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human

placental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later

phase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by

the ovary. Let us remember

that hCG, hPL and relaxin

are produced in women

only during pregnancy. In

addition, during pregnancy

the levels of other hormones

like estrogens, progestogens,

cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,

etc., are increased several-

folds in the maternal blood.

Increased production of these

hormones is essential for

supporting the fetal growth,

metabolic changes in the

mother and maintenance of

pregnancy.

Immediately after

implantation, the inner cell

mass (embryo) differentiates
