    "assertion": "Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region of the fallopian tube.",
    "reason": "Not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.",
    "answer": "Both Assertion and Reason are true, and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion."
  },
  {
    "assertion": "During fertilisation, the sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum.",
    "reason": "Contact with the zona pellucida induces changes in the ovum membrane that prevent entry of additional sperms.",
    "answer": "Both Assertion and Reason are true, and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion."
  },
  {
    "assertion": "Multiple sperms can fertilise a single ovum during normal fertilisation.",
    "reason": "Changes in the ovum membrane after sperm entry block the entry of additional sperms.",
    "answer": "Assertion is false, but Reason is true."
  },
  {
    "assertion": "The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter the cytoplasm of the ovum.",
    "reason": "The acrosome reaction allows the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida and plasma membrane of the ovum.",
    "answer": "Both Assertion and Reason are true, and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion."
